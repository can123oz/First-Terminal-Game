Hello there :)

Welcome to my first ever 2D game.

This is built for an training drill for learning and understanding classes better.

In this game, user is creating a 2d field with random traps in it.
The goal is to find the hat which created with random position in the field.

In the field you will see these types of characters

 Hat  '^'
 Hole  'O'
 This is field 'â–‘'
 This is you  '*'


The controls are :

---> `W` is for going up
---> `S` is for going down
---> `A` is for going left
---> `D` is for going right

have fun :)
